# keyprint-kerning

this is part of a in-depth exploration of keystroke patterns as unqiue identifiers. the name of the larger project is called "keyprints". this program is written using p5.js and transforms a piece of text based on personal keyprints. <br><br>
a keyprint is a data set, that collects the average time intervals of any combination of two keys on a keyboard that it takes a specific person to type.<br><br>
Keyprint-kerning maps these average time intervals to the distance between any two letters of a text.
